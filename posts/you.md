you
thank you
perhaps it is too little
too little to just utter two words
for you’ve placed so much of you in me
so much that i placed so much of me in you
this conscious effort of placing trust
placing love with all strings attached
you’ve birthed a part of me
a part that’s tickled a softer i
let me kiss your eyes
your hands and all of you
for i am thankful
thankful for showing me all you did
you see i’ve never been dealt with so much patience
so much care and so much of it all
I guess the good in you
helps me explore the good in me
you
thank you
