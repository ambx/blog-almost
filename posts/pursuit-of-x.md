preview: 'We, as humans, are forever looking for reasons to let go of everything and celebrate, right? Celebrate with lessons taught to us by life, to help better ourselves for whatever reason we’re here for or plainly put, maybe just to puff off the undesired tension around.
I, like most people, love celebrations. This practice of acknowledgement, of appreciation, of loosening up, does things to our otherwise overworked and crippling spirits......'

Red-lettered are those rhythms, in this blink we call a lifetime,

When a ‘once upon a time’ stranger confounds us with their chime.

Enveloped by people from our very first cry,

How mystically understandment in you finds its stairs.

How beautifully bits start falling falling into place.

Intriguing, it is how one particle could radiate so much,

It could change the composition of an entire bunch.

A ‘once upon a time’ stranger once timidly told me,

“Perhaps everything wonderful comes from nothingness, Lee.”

Little did I know, this walking ball of confetti,

Was desperately on the hunt for something….something that would let her free.

What was her ‘something’ was an unfounded mystery,

But it would be her antidote to everything she assured me…and herself, vaguely.

Weird. Weird, I wondered how every one of our amigo,

Is on an expedition in the pursuit of x by zero.
