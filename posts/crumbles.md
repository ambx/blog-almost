As I prepare to unwind after a day’s long struggle to conclude the plain nuisance of daily routine beyond my doorstep, something in me triggers utter stillness and coldness. See here’s the thing, I don’t like, or rather, I fear being confronted by the chemical reactions that are created in my very own head. One could never realize the world of power this abstract idea called ‘thoughts’ could hold.

Layered by layers of pretense, aren’t we all burdened by heavy trunks of ‘packaged’ fears, well nurtured and adorned by the bygones of yesterday, within us? I’d hesitate to admit that I fear my thoughts. Perhaps, I’d even hesitate to admit that I hesitate to do so.

If thoughts hold powers to build mountains, I believe they even hold powers to crumble that very mountain down. It is the latter that scares me. Walled by negativity from all sides since I could last remember, I suppose sucking out every drop of light has become a part of me. How do I go beyond this human frame and attain what I’ve forever romanticized….peace of mind. Maybe you could lend a hand?
