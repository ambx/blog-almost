‘Perhaps…’ she wondered as she wrapped herself,

In the misty-vague mirage of hers. 

‘Unreal, it is’ she whispered, coldly,

As she shoed the distant tinkle away. 

‘But, every cloud has its silver lining’,

She assured herself blankly unsure. 

Hopes and whispers tingled around,

With the evergreen battles soaring higher and higher. 

Princes and castles and horses weren’t her fantasy,

It was just, ‘If I were to discard my shell’.
