preview: 'There comes a time in all our lives where we meet someone and we are just beyond amazed. Everything about them screams "Woahh"! This is a tiny piece on one such friend of mine, who I co-incidentally stumbled upon in high school. I unlearned and learned so much from her over the course of many years we remained friends.'

Red-lettered are those rhythms, in this blink we call a lifetime,

When a ‘once upon a time’ stranger confounds us with their chime.

Enveloped by people from our very first cry,

Yet…it is strangers like these who unfold, nothing it is we know about particles of our own dye.

How mystically understandment in you finds its stairs.

How beautifully bits start falling falling into place.

Intriguing, it is how one particle could radiate so much,

It could change the composition of an entire bunch.

A ‘once upon a time’ stranger once timidly told me,

“Perhaps everything wonderful comes from nothingness, Lee.”

Little did I know, this walking ball of confetti,

Was desperately on the hunt for something….something that would let her free.

What was her ‘something’ was an unfounded mystery,

But it would be her antidote to everything she assured me…and herself, vaguely.

Weird. Weird, I wondered how every one of our amigo,

Is on an expedition in the pursuit of x by zero.
