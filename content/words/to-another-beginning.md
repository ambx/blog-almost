As much as I fear expressing myself, I was equally ‘gratefully disgusted’ by 2018. To pen it down in mere words, 2018 was a year of utter chaos vacuuming out every inch of everything in me, while at the same time managed to convince me to believe in “Zindagi na milegi dobara!”. I’d never want to relive this year. Nothing of it. Yet, this year has been a major source of ‘enlightenment’. Enlightenment in terms of human relations, emotions, adjustment? I don’t even know. Nothing of this ‘enlightenment’, as I’d like to call it, came easy and hence, I am gratefully disgusted by it.

The whole ‘new year-new you’ thing, I’ve never been able to comprehend it. But what I did comprehend is, we as humans, are forever looking for reasons to let go of everything and celebrate. Celebrate with lessons been taught to help better ourselves for whatever reason we are here for. So cheers to 2018 and cheers to 2019.

Happy New Year, it is!
