Perhaps, it is this facade that I’ve wrapped myself with,

Perhaps, it is this mockery turned into filth,

Perhaps, it is the particles around being non-resistant,

Perhaps, it is just me feeding the ‘non-existent’,

Whatever it is, I’m tired.

Tired of battling against me for me,

Tired of hushing the unsaid against all of actuality,

Tired of boasting this extravagant show of pretense,

Tired of wanting to be in another tense,

Whatever it is….
