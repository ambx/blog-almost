preview: 'As someone who has been battling with anxiety all her life, basic activities stand as major struggles to me. It drains a lot of my already drained energy. In those moments where I hesitantly yet quite reflexly swallow words that were supposed to be heard, I sink a little deeper and loathe myself a bit more than the moment before. This inability to function around people like a normal person for once, it is killing me.'

‘Perhaps…’ she wondered as she wrapped herself,

In the misty-vague mirage of hers. 

‘Unreal, it is’ she whispered, coldly,

As she shoed the distant tinkle away. 

‘But, every cloud has its silver lining’,

She assured herself blankly unsure. 

Hopes and whispers tingled around,

With the evergreen battles soaring higher and higher. 

Princes and castles and horses weren’t her fantasy,

It was just, ‘If I were to discard my shell’.
