preview: I think I am forever lost between seeing and realizing the difference between seeking attention and paying attention. I often keep telling myself numerous times, over and over, that I do not want attention. I keep chanting this so many times, only so I actually engrain it in me. But who am I kidding?

As people, we are all naturally attracted to the idea of attracting attention. I think I am forever lost between seeing and realizing the difference between seeking attention and paying attention. Being the Hypocrite that I am, I go on rambling to my friends and family that I hate being the centre of attention, not realising that that very statement is a medium to harness the attention I so dearly crave.
It was a recent turn of wave, when this realization suddenly hit me. What followed next was pure denial. I refused to admit that I was just another plastic beneath another plastic, dying for a sort of acknowledgement from anyone and anybody. I think somewhere down the line, this lack of self-love, I've been nurturing for oh-so-many years, forced me to find validation in others around. I was forever told humility is a virtue one should always carry. I think as a young girl, I confused myself with the definitions of humility and self-hate, and I'm still struggling to clear it out to myself. We're all naive beings, aren't we? The fact that my very naiveness birthed that question amuses me. Maybe we're all naive, funny beings, then?
I know very little about the world, about humans, about anything. There's so much I understand very little or nothing at all about. So I don't really know if my lack of self-love actually triggered my thirst for this black hole of attention. Perhaps, I will never know.
